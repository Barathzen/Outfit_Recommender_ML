# Outfit_Recommender_ML
This project aims to provide outfit recommendations based on user input for weather conditions and color preferences. The core functionality is powered by a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) machine learning model implemented in Python using the Flask framework. The model predicts the most suitable outfit from a dataset of outfit combinations.
